core java interview questions:

1)why java is not 100% object oriented programming language?
	Because of primitive datatypes namely: byte,short,int,long,double,char,boolean,float
	To make them Object oriented we have wrapper classes which actually "wrap" the primitive data type into an object of that class

1a) what is JDK,JRE & JVM in java?
A: JDK stands for java development kit which is a software used to develope and run java application. It contains JRE, compiler, debugger,javadoc & keytool
   JRE stands for java runtime envinronment which provides platform to run java application in run time. It contains JRE and class libraries
   JVM stands for java virtual machine which is the heart of java. It converts bytecode into machine code. and it is platform dependent
   
 1b)can we define java class without a main method?
 A: No. from java7 we can not run java application without main method but before java7 its possible as like below
 
 public class Main{
 	
	static{
		System.out.println("Yes its printing...");
	}
}

1c) can we make main method as final in java?
A: yes. we can make main method as final so that its subclasses can not ovveride main method

1d)what is List & set?
List is an ordered collection which maintains insertion order and can store any number of null values
Set is unordered collection which does not maintain insertion order and store atmost one null value


2)why pointers are not allowed in java?
	Because i)They are unsafe
		ii)Increases the complexity of the program and since java is known for simplicity of code, adding the concepts of pointers will be 
		contradicting
		iii)since JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory by the user, pointers
		are discourged in java

3)what is JIT Compiler?
       The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Java™ Runtime Environment(JRE) that improves the performance of Java applications at run time.

4)Why String is immutable in java?
	Because i)String pool requires string to be immutable otherwise shared references can be changed  from anywhere
		ii)Security because string is shared on different file system,networking connection,database connection, having immutable string
		allows you to be secure and safe because no one can change reference of string once its get created
	Note:String pool is the place where all literals of string to be kept

5)what is marker interface?
	A marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data members and member functions.In simpler words,an empty interface is called 
	marker interface
	example: public interface Cloneable{
		 }

6)Can you override private or static method in java?
	we can not ovveride private or static methods in java because parent class private method is completely not accessable in child class so
	evn if we create similar private method in child class it will be treated as new method eventhough the names,return type & arguments of 
	both methods are similar. 

	For static methods,if we create similar method with same return type and arguments in child class then it will hide superclass method
	this is also known as "method hidding"

7)Does finally always execute in java?
	Not in following cases i) if we use System.exit() function
			       ii) system crash 

8)What methods does the Object Class have?
	Object Class is the parent class of all classes which are created 
	i) protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
		-->Creates and returns a copy of this object
	ii)public boolean equals(Object obj)
		-->Indicates Whether some other object is "equal to" this one
	iii)protected void finalize() throws Throwable
		-->Called by garbage collector on an object  where garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object
	iv)public final Class getClass()
		-->returns Runtime class of an object
	v)public int hashCode()
		-->returns a hash code value of an object
	vi)public String toString()
		-->returns a string representation of an object
	vii)public final void notify()
	viii)public final void notifyAll()
	ix)public final void wait()
	 x)public final void wait(long timeout)
	xi)public final void wait(long timeout,int nanos)
 
9)How can you make a class Immutable?
	steps:i)Declare the class as final so it can't be be extended
	      ii)Make all fields private so that direct access is not allowed
	      iii)Don't provide setter methods for varaibles
	      iv)make all mutable fileds as final so thats its value can be assigned only once
	      v)Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing a deep copy
	      vi)Perform cloning of an object in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returing the actual object reference

10)What is Singleton class in java ad how can we make a class singleton?
	Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time in one JVM 
	Example:
		public class Animal{
			private static Animal single_instance = null;
			
			private Animal(){
			}

			public static Animal getInstance()
			{
				if(single_instance == null)
				{
					single_instance = new Animal();
				}
			  return single_instance;
			}
		}
10a)what is memory leak in java application? what are its types? how to detect memory leaks?
A: A memory leak is a situation where unused objects occupy unnecessary space in memory.It reduces application performance.
   Types:- i)Through static fields: Excessive usage of static fileds leads meamory leakage
           ii)Unclosed Resources: Resourses such as connections and streams utilize memory. if they are not closed leads memory leakage
	   iii)Improper equals() and hashCode() methods implementations
  How to detect:
  	i)Using memory profilers: Memory profilers are tools that can monitor memory usage and help detect memory leaks in an application.some are Java VisualVM,   JProfiler and YourKit.
	ii)using Verbose Garbage Collection: To obtain a detailed trace of the Java GC, verbose garbage collection can be enabled by adding -verbose:gc parameter
	in JVM configuration
	
10b)what is stringTokenizer in java?
A: A StringTokenizer class is a class present in the java.util package and it is used to break a String into tokens.It tokenize the string on the basis of the delimiters provided to the String tokenizer class object.The Common delimiters are the whitespaces, tab, newline, carriage return, and form feed.

10c)what is the Importance of wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods in Java?
A: The threads can communicate with each other through wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods in Java. These are final methods defined in the Object class
   wait(): It simply pauses the thread until either specific number of milli seconds have left or it receives any notification from another thread 
   notify(): notify() method sends the notification to only one thread among the multiple waiting threads which are waiting for lock.
   notifyAll(): notifyAll() methods  sends the notification to all waiting threads instead of single one thread.

10c1) why wait(),notify(),notifyAll() methods kept in Object class?
A:  If wait() and notify() were on the Thread instead then each thread would have to know the status of every other thread and there is no way to know thread1 that  thread2 was waiting for any resource to access. Hence, notify, wait, notifyAll methods are defined in object class in Java

10c2) What are daemon threads in java?
A: Daemon threads are threads which run in background and works for the benefit of other threads. Garbage collector is one of the good example for daemon threads

10c3) what is the purpose of nested classes in java?
A: The purpose of nested classes is to group classes that belong together, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

10d)What are class variables, instance variables and local variables in Java?
A: class varaiables also know as static variables that are declared in class outside method or constructor with static keyword
   instance variable are declared in class outside method or constructor
   local variable is declared inside methods or constructors
   
   Note: There is no concept of Global varaibles in java
   
10e) Will a finally block execute after a return statement in a method in Java?
A: Yes, the finally block will be executed even after a return statement in a method.
 eg: public static int count() {
      try {
         return 1;
      } catch(Exception e) {
         return 2;
      } finally {
         System.out.println("Finally block will execute even after a return statement in a method");
      }
    }
    
10f)Can we have a return statement in the catch or, finally blocks in Java?
A:  Yes, we can write a return statement of the method in catch and finally block.
 Eg: int calc() {
      try {
         return 10;
      } catch(Exception e) {
         return 20;
      } finally {
         return 30;
      }
   }
10e) Is it possible to have multiple try blocks with only one catch block in java?
A: We cannot have multiple try blocks with a single catch block. Each try block must be followed by catch or finally. Still if you try to have single catch block for multiple try blocks a compile time error is generated.

 class ExceptionExample{
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int a,b;
      try {
         a=Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
         b=Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
      }
      try {
         int c=a/b;
         System.out.println(c);
      }catch(Exception ex) {
         System.out.println("Please pass the args while running the program");
      }
   }
}

10f)Can we have a try block without a catch block in Java?
A: Yes, It is possible to have a try block without a catch block by using a finally block.

public class TryBlockWithoutCatch {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         System.out.println("Try Block");
      } finally {
         System.out.println("Finally Block");
      }
   }
}

10g)Can we have an empty catch block in Java?
A: Yes, we can have an empty catch block. But this is a bad practice to implement in Java.Generally, the try block has the code which is capable of producing exceptions that is caught by the catch block.

10h) what is exception? what is exception handling?types of exception in java?
In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
exception handling is the mechanism which is used to maintain normal flow of execution of java application.
Types:
		Throwable class
			|
		-------------------
		|		   |
	Exception		Error--------->StackOverFlowError,OutOfMemoryError,VirtualMachineError
	    |
            |---IOException
	     -- SQLException
	     --ClassNotFoundException
	     --FileNotFoundException
	     --RunTimeException|
	     			|---Arithemetic Exception
				 --NullPointer Exception
				 --ArrayIndexOutOfBound
				 --StringIndexOutOfBound
				 
CheckedException: The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

UncheckedExceptions: The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.


10i) What is serializable?
A: Serializable is a marker interface which does not contain any data members and methods.It is used to mark java class so that objects of this class may get certain capabilities

10i1) What is serialization and deserialization in java?
A: Serialization is the mechanism of converting the state of  object into byte stream.
   Deserialization is the reverse process where byte stream is used to recreate the actual java object. 
   This entire mechanism is used to persist java object
   
10i2)How can you make object a serializable in java?
A: To make object serializable , 
 serialization--> class must implements serializable interface and use ObjectOutputStream which extends OutputStream to write java objects to stream
 Deserialization--> use ObjectInputStream which extends InputStream to read java objects from stream
 
 10i3)  what is SerialVersionUID? and its importance?
 A: SerialVersionUID is a 64 bit long value which is hashcode of all properties of class and can be used to verify whether deserialized object is same or not with respect to serialized object. If both are not same then JVM throws InvalidClassException
 
10i4) Differences between HashMap,HashTable, Synchronized HashMap & CuncurrentHashMap? -->  All are concurrent collections in java, https://youtu.be/UwurUtvil7w

		Synchronized 		Locking			No of Threads		Null 		Iterator 	When to use	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HashMap		It is not		No Lock 		Multiple Threads    1 null Key		Fail Fast	Single Threaded Environment
		Synchronized							    N no of null
										    values
												
HashTable	All operations		object level		 1 Thread	    Does not allow	Fail Safe	It is leagacy class& not 
		are synchronized	Locking					    Null Key Null			recommended to use
										    values
										
Synchronized	All operations 		object level		 1 Thread	    1 null key		Fail Fast	MultiThreaded Environment
HashMap		are synchronized	Locking					    N no of null
									            values
										    
Concurrent	Only Write		segment level		16 Threads	   Does not allow	Fail Safe	MultiThreaded Environment
HashMap		Operations are		Locking			write & N	   Null keys Null
		synchronized					Threads read	   Values
		
Note:
Fail-fast throws ConcurrentModification Exception whenever we try to do structural modification of HashMap/Synchronized HashMap

HashMap vs Synchronized HashMap
HashMap vs Concurrent HashMap
Synchronized HashMap vs Concurrent HashMap

10i4) What is the internal working of HashMap? https://youtu.be/1CJbB6SzjVw
A: HashMap stores objects in the form of key and values. key always unique and values might be null. HashMap internally contains HashCode() and equals() menthod.
HashCode() is used to determinde hashvalue based on key. This hash value is used as index to store key values in HashMap. Suppose if Two keys produces same hash values(same index) then hashmap uses equals() methods to compare both keys. if keys are same then hashmap replaces existing key value pair with new pair. if key were found different then hashmap adds key value pair next of existing key value pair in same index

Note: before java8 ,linkedlist was used as node to store key value pairs in hashmap but after java8 they are using balanced tree to store key values pairs this is the enhancement from java8



11)What is java class Loader? Explain its principles and its types?
	Class Loader is an abstract class which belongs to java.lang package.It is used to load the classes from different resources at run time
	Java class loader is based on 3 principles:
		a)Delegation Principle: It forwards the request for class loading to parent class loader
		b)Visibility Principle: It allows child class loader to see all the classes loaded by parent classloader
		c)Uniqueness Principle: It allows to load a class once.It is acheived by deligation principle
	Types:
		1)Boostrap class loader:It loads classes from jre/lib/rt.jar directory. It is a parent of all class loaders.
		2)Extensions class loader: It loads classes from jre/lib/ext or java.ext.dirs directory It deligates class loading to its parent
		3)System class loader: It loads classes from CLASSPATH environment variable or using -cp or -classpath command line options 

12)Is Java pass by value or pass by reference?
	Java is always pass  by values because it always creates copy of references and pass them as valuable to methods. 

13)what is comparable and comparator interface in java?
	Comparable: Comparable interface is used to sort the objects of the user-defined class.This interface is found in java.lang package 
	and contains only one method named compareTo(Object).It provides single sorting sequence only i.e we can sort the elements on the basis of
	single data member
	
	Comparator: Comparator interface is also used to sort the objects of the user-defined class. This interface is found in java.util package 
	and contains 2 methods namely compare(Obj 1, Obj 2) and  equals(Object element).It provides multiple sorting sequence i.e we can sort the 
	elsements on the basis of any data member

14)Can we reduce visibility of inherited method in java?
	we can't reduce visibility of inherited method in java.we will get compile time error . To avoid this, either we reduce visibility of the
	parent method or increase the visibility of the inherited method
	
	Resolution:
	========
	Either reduce the visibility of the parent method.  
	-------------------------------------------------
	public class ParentTest {
    		private String element = "Hello";
 
    		private String getString(){
       			return element;
    		}
	}

	public class Test extends ParentTest {
    		private String element = "Hello";

    		private String getString(){
       			return element;
    		}
	}

	or Increase the visibility of the derived method.
	-----------------------------------------------
	public class ParentTest {
    		private String element = "Hello";
 
    		public String getString(){
       			return element;
    		}
	}

	public class Test extends ParentTest {
		private String element = "Hello";

    		public String getString(){
			return element;
		}	
    	}
15)inheritence-->Is-A relation ship in java
   
16)What is Association(HAS-A), Composition, Aggregration in Java?
	Association refers to the relationship between multiple objects. It refers to how objects are related to each other and how they are using 
	each other's functionality. We can describe the Association as a has-a relationship between the classes.Composition and aggregation are two 
	types of association.
	
	The composition is the strong type of association. An association is said to composition if an Object owns another object and another object
	cannot exist without the owner object. Consider the case of Human having a heart. Here Human object contains the heart and heart cannot exist 
	without Human
	
	Example of Composition:
		//Car must have Engine
		public class Car {
   			//engine is a mandatory part of the car
   			private final Engine engine;
   			public Car () {
      				engine = new Engine();
   			}
		}

		//Engine Object
		class Engine {}
	
	Aggregation is a weak association. An association is said to be aggregation if both Objects can exist independently. For example, a Team object
	and a Player object. The team contains multiple players but a player can exist without a team.
	
	Example of Aggregation:
		
		//Team
		public class Team {      
  		 //players can be 0 or more
   			private List players;
   			public Car () {
      				players = new ArrayList();
   			}
		 }
//Player Object
class Player {}

17)What do we need Java Design pattern(well documention of tested solution)? [https://youtu.be/JFvSCobD7JU]
	Design pattern gives a software developer an array of tried and tested solutions to common problems, thus reducing the technical risks to the 
	project by not having to employ new and untested design ,thus saving time and  effort during the implementation stage of software development
	life cycle
					
					Design pattern
			________________________|_________________________
			Creational	Behavioral	Structural	J2EE
			patterns	patterns	patterns	patterns
 __________________________|___________________
 factory  Abstract  Builder  prototype Singleton
 pattern  factory
	  pattern

Creational patterns: These patterns related to the way of creating the objects.It also used to define and describe how objects are created at class
instantiated time 
a)Factory pattern:In this pattern, we don't expose the creation logic to the client and  refer the created object using a standard interface
		  The factory pattern is also known as "virtual constructor"
		  steps:
			i)create  main class which call factory class
			ii)factory class returns required class instance
		
		  Example:      Profession.java

				package abstract_factory.pattern;
				public interface Profession {
				void print();
				}		
		                
				Engineer.java 
				
				package abstract_factory.pattern;
				public class Engineer implements Profession{

					@Override
					public void print() {
					System.out.println("In Print of Engineer class");
		
					}

				}
			
				Teacher.java 
				package abstract_factory.pattern;
				public class Teacher implements Profession{

					@Override
					public void print() {
					System.out.println("In Print of Teacher class");
					}

				}

				ProfessionFactory.java
				package abstract_factory.pattern;
				public class ProfessionFactory{
					@Override
					public Profession getProfession(String typeOfProfession){
		  				if(typeOfProfession == null){
	         					return null;
	      					}		
	         
		  				if(typeOfProfession.equalsIgnoreCase("Engineer")){
	         					return new Engineer();
	      					} 
						else if(typeOfProfession.equalsIgnoreCase("Teacher")){
	         					return new Teacher();
	      					}
	      
	      				return null;
	   			       }
				}
				
				FactoryPatternMainClass.java 
				package abstract_factory.pattern;
				public class FactoryPatternMainClass {
	
					public static void main(String[] args) {
						ProfessionFactory professionFactory = new ProfessionFactory();
						Profession doc = professionFactory.getProfession("Engineer");
						doc.print();
					}
				}

Singleton design pattern:  refer question no:10

18)Why JAVA 8? Main agenda behind JAVA8?
	The significant reason for introducing java 8  was to Conciseness in the code .It brings functional programming by enabling lambda expressions
	(a powerful tool to create concise code base). If we recall past, python and scale did this type of conciseness in code so by mid 20s java lost
	a market due to this languages.hence to prevent furthre lose java upgraded itself from only OOPS language to some functional programming
	to create concise code base

19)What are new features which got introduced in java8?
	1)Lambda expressions
	2)Stream API
	3)Default methods in the interface
	4)Static methods
	5)Functional Interface
	6)Optional
	7)Method references
	8)Date API
	9)Nashron,JavaScript Engine
20)What are main advantages of  using java8?
	1)Compact code(less boilerplate code)
	2)More readable and reusable code
	3)More testable code
	4)Parallel operations

21) What is lambda expression?
	Lambda expression is an anonymous function (without name,return type,and access modifiers and having one lambda -> symbol)
	public void add(int a,int b){
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}
	
	(a,b)-> System.out.println(a+b)

22)what are functional interface?
	The functional interfaces are those interfaces which  can have only one abstract method. It can have any number of static method,default methods.
	There are already many functional interfaces that are present in java egs: Comparable, Runnable
23)Can we create own functional interface?
	Yes. By following below steps
	a)Create an interface
	b)Annotated with @FunctionalInterface
	c)Define exactly one Abstract method
	d)There is no restriction on number of static and  default methods can defined in that interface

	Java implicitly identifies functinal interfaces but still you can also annotate with @FunctionalInterface.It just give you the security that
	in case if you by mistake add  2 abstract methods then compiler will throw compiler time error

	

24)How lambda expressions and functional interfaces are related to each other?
	Functional interfaces is used to provide reference to lambda expression
	eg: Comparator<String> c = (s1,s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)
	
	FunctionalInterfaceDemo.java
			
		@FunctionalInterface
		public interface FunctionalInterfaceDemo{
			void singleAbstractMethod();
		}
	FunctionalInterfaceMain.java
		
		public static void main(String[] args){
		  FunctionalInterfaceDemo f = () -> System.out.println("This is implemtation of Functinal interface abstract method using lambda exp");

	
25)What is method reference in java8?
	Method reference is a replacement of lambda expressions. It is used to refer method of functional interface to an existing method.
	Mainly it is used for code reusability.Functional interface's abstract method can be mapped to specific existing method using double colon(::)
	operator .This is method reference.Hence method reference is an alternative to Lambda expression
	
	whenever we have existing implementation  of abstract method of our functional interface then we can go for method reference. if no such
	implimented method then we can go for lambda expression

	example:
		FunctionalInterfaceDemo.java
			
			@FunctionalInterface
			public interface FunctionalInterfaceDemo{
				void singleAbstractMethod();
			}
		
		MethodReferenceDemo.java
			public class MethodReferenceDemo{
				public static void main(String[] args){
					FunctionalInterfaceDemo functionalInterfaceDemo = Test :: testImplimentation;
					functionalInterfaceDemo.singleAbstractMethod();
				}
			}
			class Test{
				public static void testImplimentation(){
					System.out.println("This is test implementation of your abstract method");
				}
			}

26)What is default methods in java8?
	The default methods are a way for adding new methods to the interface without affecting the implimenting classes.Hence with this new feature
	java people defended many compile time errors that may arise due to unimplemented  methods of interface
	
	without default method concept:
	------------------------------
	InterfaceDemo.java
		public interface InterfaceDemo{
			void printName();  //if we declare like this all implementation classes got errors
	        }
        InterfaceImpl1.java
		public class InterfaceImpl1 implements InterfaceDemo{
		//here no implimented method hence got error in this file
		}
	with default method concept:
	----------------------------
	InterfaceDemo.java
		public interface InterfaceDemo{
			default void printName() {      //if we declare like this none of implementation classes got errors
	        	       System.out.println("This is default implementation of interface");
		        }
		}
	InterfaceImpl1.java
		public class InterfaceImpl1 implements InterfaceDemo{
		//here no implimented method still we don't get any errors in this file bcz of default method in parent interface
			public ststic void main(String[] args){
				InterfaceImpl1 imp1 = new InterfaceImpl1();
				imp1.printName(); -->[o/p: This is default implementation of interface]
		}
	InterfaceImpl2.java
		public class InterfaceImpl2 implements InterfaceDemo{
		//here i want to ovveride default method in parent interface
			public static void main(String[] args){
				InterfaceImpl2 imp2 = new InterfaceImpl2();
				imp2.printName();
			}
			
			public void printName(){
				System.out.println("This is ovveride message of  default method of parent interface");
			}
		}
		
27)Is it necessary to override default methods in java8?
	i)Default methods have dummy implementations
	ii)Implementing classes if ok with dummy implementations then use dummy impl of default methods 
	ii)if not satisfied then they can ovveride and provide their own implementations
	
	example:
	--------
	InterfaceDemo.java
		public interface InterfaceDemo{
			default void printName() {      //if we declare like this none of implementation classes got errors
	        	       System.out.println("This is default implementation of interface");
		        }
		}
	
	InterfaceImpl2.java
		public class InterfaceImpl2 implements InterfaceDemo{
		//here i want to ovveride default method in parent interface
			public static void main(String[] args){
				InterfaceImpl2 imp2 = new InterfaceImpl2();
				imp2.printName();
			}
			
			public void printName(){
				System.out.println("This is ovveride message of  default method of parent interface");
			}
		}

28)Is default keyword one of the access modifiers?
	i)Default is not the access modifier like public or protected or private
	ii)For default access access modifiers we don't use any keyword
	iii)hence default keyword was only used in classess till java1.8 version for switch case only but never in interface
	iv)Now its used for default methods in interface to provide a default implimentations for all implementing classes to use
29)Explain how default methods in interface cope up with Diamond problem?
	If two implemented interfaces contains same default methods then its the diamond probelm
	In java, in such situations the code will not compile
	Solution to dimond problem:
	-------------------------
	Use InterfaceName.super.methodName();
	
	example:
		DiamondProbelmInterface1.java
		public interface DiamondProbelmInterface1{
			default void m1(){
			System.out.println("Interface 1 implementation");
			}
		}
		
		DiamondProbelmInterface2.java
		public interface DiamondProbelmInterface2{
			default void m1(){
			System.out.println("Interface 2 implementation");
			}
		}
		
		DiamondProbelmMain.java
		public class DiamondProbelmMain implements DiamondProbelmInterface1,DiamondProbelmInterface2{
			public void m1(){
				DiamondProbelmInterface1.super.m1();
			}
			public static void main(String[] args){
				DiamondProbelmMain  dpm = new DiamondProbelmMain();
				dpm.m1();
			}
			
			
		}
30)Why static methods were introduced in interface in java8?
	Only reason for introducing static methods in interface is that  you can call those methods with just interface name.No need to create class
	and then its objects 
	example:
		InterfacewithStaticMethod.java
		public interface InterfacewithStaticMethod{
			static void statMethod(){
				System.out.println("This is static method from interface");
			}
		}
		InterfacewithStaticMethodMain.java
		public class InterfacewithStaticMethodMain implements InterfacewithStaticMethod{
			InterfacewithStaticMethod.statMethod();
		}
31)Are static methods in interface available to implementing classes by default in java8?
	Static methods are not available to all implementing classes .They are not default methods.they are just static.Hence we can call these 
	methods using interface name explicitly from the implementing classes as implementing classes wont have access to these methods directly
	(This is the disadvantage of static methods of interface that its not available to all implementing classes)

32)What are predicates in java 8?
	predicate is defined functional interface having only one abstract method i.e public boolean  test(T t). This is used to check some boolean
	condition
	
	example:
		without predicate
		------------------
		
			package predicate_demo
			import java.util.function.Predicate;
			public class PredicateFunctionDemo {
				public static void main(String[] args){
				PredicateFunctionDemo predicateFunctionDemo = new PredicateFunctionDemo ();
				System.out.println(predicateFunctionDemo.testStringLength("code decode"));
 				}
				public boolean testStringLength(String s){
					if(s.length()>=5)
						return true;
					else
						return false;
				}
			}
			
		with predicate
		--------------
			package predicate_demo
			import java.util.function.Predicate;
			public class PredicateFunctionDemo {
				public static void main(String[] args){
				Predicate<String> checkLength = s -> s.length() >=5;
				System.out.println(The length of string is greater than 5: "+ checkLength.test("code decode"));
 				}	
			}

33)When will we use predicates?
	we use predicates in the situation where we will need to check conditions with the help of single abstract method test()
34) what is type of predicate input parameters and return type?
	Input to predicate can be anything Predicate<String>,Predicate<Integer>,Predicate<Employee>. hence only one input type argument is required 
	for predicate. and there is not return type for predicates as it always returns boolean only
35)what are the advantages of predicates?
	i)code reusability(1 time declarationa and can be used as many times in anywhere in java appliaction)
	ii)conditional checks are holded by functional interfaces
36)what is predicate joining?
	It is used to join one or more predicates. we can acheive this in 3 ways by using AND ,OR & Negate
	example:
		PredicateJoining.java
		package predicate_joining
		import java.util.function.Predicate;
		public class PredicateJoining {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Predicate<String> checkLength = s->s.length()>=5;
				System.out.println("The length of string is grater than 5: "+ checkLength.test("code decode"));
				Predicate<String> checkEvenLength = s->s.length()%2==0;
				System.out.println("The length of string is  "+ checkEvenLength.test("code decode"));
				System.out.println("after merging with and " + checkLength.and(checkEvenLength).test("code decode"));
				System.out.println("after merging with or " + checkLength.or(checkEvenLength).test("code decode"));
				System.out.println("after merging with negate " + checkLength.negate().test("code decode"));
			}
		}

37)What are functions in java8?
	Function is also a predefined functional interface which is having only one abstract method i.e R apply(T t).As we know predicate as it only 
	returns boolean value without return type.hence this functions overcomes this disadvantage by returning all types of values
	example:
		FunctionDemo.java
		package function_demo;
		import java.util.function.Function;
		public class FunctionDemo {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Function<Integer,Integer> squareMe = i -> i*i;
				System.out.println("Square of 5 is "+squareMe.apply(5));
			}
		}

38)What are the differences between predicate and function in java8?
	prdicate			function
i)It has the return type as 	i)It has return type as Object.It is used 				  
  Boolean value & it is used 	  to perform operations and return results	
  for conditional checks

ii)It is written in the form	ii)It is written in the form of Function<T,R>
Predicate<T> which accepts	   which also acceptes single argument but
single arguments		   return any type of Object denoted by R

iii)It contains test()		iii)It contains apply() method
   method.

39)what is functional chaining?
	It is used to combine multiple functions together with andThen or compose
	There are 2 ways to combine
		i)f1.andThen(f2).apply(Input); -->first f1 then f2
		ii)f1.compose(f2).apply(Input);--> first f2 then f1
	Multiple functions can be combined like as follows
		f1.andThen(f2).andThen(f3).andThen(f4).apply(Input);

	example:
		FunctionDemo.java
		package function_demo;
		import java.util.function.Function;
		public class FunctionDemo {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Function<Integer,Integer> doubleIt = i -> 2*i;
				System.out.println("Double it "+ doubleIt.apply(2)); --->4
				
				Function<Integer,Integer> cubeIt = i -> i*i*i;
				System.out.println("Double it "+ cubeIt.apply(2)); ----->8
				
				System.out.println("First doubling using apply " + doubleIt.andThen(cubeIt).apply(2)); ---->64
				System.out.println("First cubing using compose " + doubleIt.compose(cubeIt).apply(2)); ----->16
			}
		}	 
40)What is consumer functional interface?
	It is used to consume item but never return anything(never supply) with the help of single abstract method public void accept(T t)
	
	example:
		ConsumerDemo.java
		package consumer_demo;
		import java.util.function.Consumer;
		public class ConsumerDemo {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Consumer<Integer> squareMe = i->System.out.println("Taking an input and performing square and returing nothing "+i*i);
				squareMe.accept(5);
				
			}
		}
41)what is consumer chaining?
	It is used to combine multiple consumers together with andThen.There is only one way to combine consumers as
	c1.andThen(c2).accept(Input);

	example:
		ConsumerDemo.java
		package consumer_demo;
		import java.util.function.Consumer;
		public class ConsumerDemo {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Consumer<Integer> squareMe = i->System.out.println("Taking an input and performing square and returing nothing "+i*i);
				squareMe.accept(5);
				
				Consumer<Integer> doubleMe = i->System.out.println("Taking an input and performing double and returing nothing "+2*i);
				doubleMe.accept(5);
			
				squareMe.andThen(doubleMe).accept(5);
			}
		}
42)what is supplier functional interface?
	It is used to supply required objects and will not consume any input with the help of single abstract method get()`and No  supplier chaining
	exists as it does not takes any inputs
	example:
		import java.util.Date;
		public class SupplierDemo{
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Supplier<Date> currentDate = () -> new Date();
				System.out.println(currentDate.get());
			}
		}
43)what is BiPredictor,BiFunction,BiConsumer? why BiSupplier does not exist?
	BiPredictor is a functional interface which is used to accept two arguments and perform operation and return only boolean output
	BiFunction is also a predefined functional interface which accepts two argumenst and produces output based on operation of two input values
	BiConsumer is also a predefined functional interface which also accepts two input arguments and does not return anything

	Bisupplier does not exist as it produces output  even without accepting single input argument 

	Exanple:
		BiDemo.java
		package Bi_demo;
		import java.util.function.BiFunction;
		public class ConsumerDemo {
			public static void main(String[] args){
				
				BiPredictor<Integer,Integer> checkSumOfTwo = (a,b) -> a+b >=5;
				System.out.println("Sum of 2 and 5 is greater than 5 : "+ checkSumOfTwo.test(2,5));
				
				BiFunction<Integer,Integer> multiplyBoth = (a,b) -> a*b;
				System.out.println("Multiply of 2 and 4 is " + multiplyBoth.apply(2,4));

				BiConsumer<Integer,Integer> squareMe = (i,j)->System.out.println("Taking an input and performing square and returing nothing "+i*j);
				squareMe.accept(5,6);
			}
		}
44)If we want to operate on 3 argument input then can we use tripredictor,triconsumer..?
	No.There is no such predefined functional interfaces in java8. It has only 1 or 2 argument inbuilt functional interfaces.
45)what are streams in java 8?
	It is a special iterator class that allows processing collections of objects in a functional manner or Streams are used to process 
	bulk objects of collection
	
	example: StreamsDemo.java
		 public class StreamsDemo{
			public static void main(String[] args){
				List<Integer> arrList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
				arrList.add(15);
				arrList.add(25);
				arrList.add(5);
				arrList.stream().filter(x -> x>=15).collect(Collectors.toList()).forEach(x->System.out.println(x));
				//arrList.stream().filter(x -> x>=15).forEach(x->System.out.println(x)); -->check this also
			}
		}
46)What are the differences between streams(java 8) and java.io.stream? 
  or Why streams were introduced in java 8 if we already have java.io.stream?
	Java.io.stream is a sequence of characters or binary data which is used to be written to a file or to read data from a file
	whereas streams are related to collection objects

47)What are the differences between streams(java 8) and collections?
	To represent group of collection as single entity then we should use collection concept
	if we want to perform operation on bulk objects in collection then we should go for streams

48)what are the steps to create and process stream?
	i)first we need to create stream object by following syntax
		Stream s= collectionObject.stream();
	ii)once we got stream object we can process the object of collection in 2 ways
		a)configuration of stream
		b)processing that configuration
	iii)configuration of stream is done by 
		a)Map b)filter
49)How to filter the stream of objects?
	syntax: Stream s = collectionObject.stream().filter(x -> x%2==0);

50)How to map the stream objects?
	It is used to create new objects against each existing stream object based on some function
	StreamsDemo.java
		 public class StreamsDemo{
			public static void main(String[] args){
				List<Integer> arrList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
				arrList.add(15);
				arrList.add(25);
				arrList.add(5);

				arrList.stream().map(x->x*x).forEach(x->System.out.println(x));
			}
		}
51)what are the difference between filter and map in java 8 ?
	if we want to filter objects from collections then we go for filter whereas if we want to perform  some opeartion on each object of the
	collection then create another mapped object with different value(after operation has performed) for each object of that collection then go
	for map

52)How do you process the streams?
	we can do processing the streams in different ways
			streams
			   |
	________________________________________
	configuration 			processing that	
	of streams			configuration
	 |                                   |

                _______________________________________________________________
	        collect      count     sorted  min max foreach     toArray    of

collect():How to process the stream elements using collect()?
	  if we want to collect elements of stream after filtering or mapping and add them to required collection then use collect() method
	  example:. 
		List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		al.add(23);
		al.add(54);
		al.add(78);
		Stream<Integer> openStream = al.stream();
		Stream<Integer> filteredStream = openStream.filter(x->x>=25);
		List<Integer> alNew = filteredStream.collect(Collectors.toList());
		alNew.stream().forEach(x->System.out.println(x));

count():How to process the stream elements using count()?
	 if we want to count how many elements are there in the processed stream then we can use count() method
	 List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		al.add(23);
		al.add(54);
		al.add(78);
		Stream<Integer> openStream = al.stream();
		Stream<Integer> filteredStream = openStream.filter(x->x>=25);
		int filteredStreamCount = filteredStream.count();

Sorted():How to process the stream elemenst using sorted()?
	 if we want to order the processed stream in a ascending order then we can use sorted() method. if we want to do customized sorting then use 
	 comparator
	example:. 
		List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		al.add(23);
		al.add(54);
		al.add(78);
		Steam<Integer> sortedArrayListStream = al.stream().filter(x->x>=25).sorted();
		sortedArrayListStream.forEach(x-> System.out.println(x));
Custom Sorting: How to process the steam elements using sorted in Desending order?
	example:. 
		List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		al.add(23);										  |-->sort in desecending
		al.add(54);										 /
		al.add(78);										/
		Steam<Integer> sortedArrayListStream = al.stream().filter(x->x>=25).sorted((i1,i2)->i2.compareTo(i1));
		sortedArrayListStream.forEach(x-> System.out.println(x));

min(): arrayList.stream().filter(x->x>=25).min((i1,i2)->i1.compareTo(i2)).get();
max():arrayList.stream().filter(x->x>=25).max((i1,i2)->i1.compareTo(i2)).get();
forEach():This method takes lambda expression as argument and apply that lambda expression to each element present in that stream
toArray():Object[] intArry = arrayList.stream().filter(x->x>=25).toArray()
	  for(Object o:intArry){
		System.out.println(o);
	 }
of(): How to process elements using of()?
	Stream concept is not applicable just for the collection its also applicable for "ANY GROUP OF VALUES" .Stream.of() method can take any group
	of values and convert tehm to stream so that multiple stream operations can be applied to it
	example: 
		Stream.of(1,2,45,65,24,98,34).forEach(x->System.out.println(x));




Angular:https://youtu.be/-jeoyDJDsSM
========

1)What is Angular? / What do you know about Angular?
A: Angular is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks developed and maintained by Google. It is an open-source front-end web framework based on 
TypeScript. It is most suited for developing enterprise web applications because its code is reusable and maintainable.


2) What are some powerful features integrated into Angular?
 Angular integrates some powerful features like declarative templates, end to end tooling, dependency injection and various other best practices that
 smoothens the development path

3)What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
		AngularJs 				Angular
	i)AngularJS was the very first version 	     i) Angular 2 was initially released in 2016. There is nothing common between Angular2 and AngularJS 
	initially released in 2010.			After that, Angular 6, Angular 7, Angular 8, Angular 9, and Angular 10 were released that are 
							very similar to each other. These later versions are known as Angular.

	ii)Angular does not components and directives. ii)Angular supports components and directives.
	
	iii)Does not support Dependency Injection	iii)Supports DI

4)What are directives in Angular?
A: Directives  are Typescript class which is declared with decorator @Directive.It tells the angular that how to change the style or behaviour of DOM 
   element
   Angular directives can be classified into three types: 
	1)Component Directives: Components are special directives in Angular. They are the directive with a template.it is actually showing something in DOM, 
	  hence we can say component is also a directive with a template (template or templateUrls).

	2)Structure Directive: Structural directives are used to change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. 
	  It basically changes the structure of the DOM

	  Examples of structural directives are ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch.

	  *ngIf — adds or removes element from DOM.
	  *ngFor — renders list of elements on every iteration.

         All structural Directives are preceded by Asterix (*)symbol.

	3)Attribute Directive: Attribute directives are used to change the appearance or behavior of an element

	  Examples of attributes directives are ngStyle, ngClass, ngModel

	  ngStyle — used to apply styles that will change the appearance.
	  ngClass — used to apply CSS classes to change the appearance.

5)What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
A: Dependencies are services in Angular which have some specific functionality. Various components and directives in an application can need these 
   functionalities of the service. Angular provides a smooth mechanism by which these dependencies are injected into components and directives.

6)What is Data Binding in Angular?
   Data-binding is a feature of Angular, which is used to provide a way to communicate between the component (Model) and its view (HTML template).
  There are two ways of data-binding, one-way data binding and two-way data binding.
   i)Onw way: Any changes in the component will directly reflect inside the HTML template but vice versa not possible
   ii)two way: vice versa possible 

7)What are  String interpolation and property binding in Angular?
  Both are the examples of Data binding.
  String Interpolation  is a one-way data-binding technique that is used to transfer the data from a component class(.ts) to an HTML template (view). 
  It uses double curly braces{{}} to display the data from the component class to the view(HTML templete)
  
  property binding helps us to set values for properties of HTML templete by passing data from component class(.ts)

8)what is Eager Loading,Lazy Loading and Pre-loading in Angular?
  Eager Loading is used to load all feature modules before the start of application . It mainly used for small size applications
  Lazy Loading is used to load all feature modues on demand after start of application. It mainly used for big size applications
  Pre-loading is used to load specific features mudules that are likely to be used soon after application started. It is used for medium size applications

9)what is component and modules in Angular?
  componet help us to bind view and model.It is the place where we write binding code.where as module is logically a group of componets

10)what is a decorator/meta data/Annotations/Data Annotations in Angular?
   Decorator defines what kind of Angular class is it. For example, if you decorate "@component" then its says its an Angular component.
   if you put "@NgModule" it becomes Angular module

11)What is template in Angular?
   Templete is an HTML view of Angular in which we can write angular syntaxes, we can use pipes,angular directives like expressions{{}},formGroup ,
   ngModel and so on
   There are 2 ways of defining template one is inline and other is a separate HTML file

12)What is Angular Routing?
  Routing is a simple collection which has mainly two things one is path/URL and 2nd one is when URL is called which component to load

13)How to implement Routing in Angular?
   i) First we need to define a collection in routing.ts file saying which URL will route to which component
   ii)second one is we need to define the <router-outlet> in html file for where exactly that navigation will load
   iii)third one is we need to define [routerLink] in html and need to give URL name. If we want to route from .ts file instead of html file then we 
      use this.route.navigate(['/home'])
